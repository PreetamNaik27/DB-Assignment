1. In the given diagram, the "Product" entity and the "Product_Category" entity are related through a one-to-many relationship. This means that each product belongs to one category, but each category can have multiple products. In database terms, this is represented by having a foreign key in the "Product" table that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table.
3. To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint. This constraint ensures that the value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must exist in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table. This way, you can guarantee that each product is associated with a valid category.
